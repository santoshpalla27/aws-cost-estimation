# AWS Cost Estimator - Frontend

**Frontend-only runtime application**. No AWS SDK, no backend, no live API calls.

## Architecture

This is the **browser runtime** component only. It consumes static pricing data generated by the separate `pricing-pipeline` project.

### What This Project Contains

✅ React frontend application
✅ Schema-driven UI components
✅ Cost calculation engines
✅ Static pricing data consumption
✅ No AWS SDK dependencies

### What This Project Does NOT Contain

❌ AWS SDK (security violation)
❌ AWS Pricing API calls
❌ Backend services
❌ Live data fetching

```

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Pricing Data

Pricing data is generated by the separate `pricing-pipeline` project and copied to `public/pricing/`.

**Never** fetch pricing data at runtime. **Always** use pre-generated static JSON.

## Adding New Services

1. Create schema in `src/schemas/`
2. Ensure pricing data exists in `public/pricing/`
3. Register service in `App.tsx`

## Bundle Size

Target: < 500KB (excluding pricing data)

Current dependencies are minimal to keep bundle small.

## Security

- No AWS credentials required
- No environment variables needed
- Fully static deployment
- Can be hosted on CDN

## Deployment

```bash
npm run build
# Deploy dist/ to any static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, S3 + CloudFront, etc.)
```
